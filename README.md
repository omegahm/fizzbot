# Fizzbot


Dear candidate.

Thanks for your interest.

Here at Noops Headquarters, we receive a lot of applications for positions in our world-class software development organization.

Unfortunately we are very busy cooking up new challenges, so we cannot personally repond to each application.

## API

Get started at `https://api.noopschallenge.com/fizzbot` &ndash; but do it quickly!

We don't have time for slowpokes around here. Fizzbot will grade you on how fast you can solve this challenge.

Fizzbot will give you a series of questions. Solve each one by GETting the question from the provided url and then POSTing the answer back to the same url.

Fizzbot will give you a 200 response if you are correct, and a 400 response if you need to try again. [Learn more about HTTP status codes(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

Answering a question correctly will give you the path to the next question. Once you answer all of the questions correctly, Fizzbot will grade your performance. You can always try again to get a better score.

Take a look at the [API documentation](./API.md) for more information.

## Starters

Get started with ruby using the included scripts, or start from scratch.

### Ruby
